fix all gcc warnings
see forkpty.w for an example how to use "select" ("select" must be used
when we analyze a protocol (i.e., when next transmitted command depends on
previously received responce); but when we just pass data back and forth,
a simple "fork" is enough, including when we must the end of transmission
signal from received data. BTW, forkpty.w must have been better written
via "fork". Decide what is more appropriate in prt.w - fork or select)
