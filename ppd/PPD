PPD file is not necessary if you print only PDF;
if you need to print many types of files, this
is the minimal PPD file:

*PPD-Adobe: "4.3"
*cupsFilter: "application/pdf 0 -"

Also, modify "script" that if $# = 7, do what is now in "script", else send stdin to printer.

For pdftopdf filter, add
duplex option from /usr/share/ppd/cupsfilters/Generic-PDF_Printer-PDF.ppd
(see PDF.ppd)
