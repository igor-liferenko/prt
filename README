If CUPS is not used, we cannot print via evince.
Evince does not pass original file to CUPS (as it should be, by the design of CUPS).
Evince transforms the file via cairo.
Therefore, we have to get original file in CUPS backend.
Pass filename via jobname (patch evince).

@PJL JOB START=x does not work, so we have to generate original .pdf with
only those pages which we want to print. Therefore, "current page" or "range" in print
dialog are useless.
Use p=<range spec as -s option in dvipdfmx> tex ...
