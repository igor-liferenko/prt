If CUPS is not used, we cannot print via evince.
Evince does not pass original file to CUPS (as it should be, by the design of CUPS).
Therefore, we need to get original file name in CUPS backend.
Pass filename via CUPS - use "cups-" prefix in option and describe it in .ppd file.

--------------------------
@PJL JOB START=x does not work (but END=y works), so we have to generate original .pdf with
only those pages which we want to print. Therefore, "current page" or "range" in print
dialog are useless.
Use p=<range spec as -s option in dvipdfmx> tex ...
