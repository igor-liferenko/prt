If CUPS is not used, we cannot print via evince.
Evince does not pass original file to CUPS (as it should be, by the design of CUPS).
Therefore, we need to get original file name in CUPS backend.
We can't pass filename via CUPS.
Read "Description" in https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk3-High-level-Printing-API.html
Therefore, approach with file was chosen.
Evince saves its own file with settings.
Before opening print dialog, remove the file with settings or empty it. This is needed for
CUPS backend to determine if the settings have been written. We also write dummy parameter
with file name, which will be read to "print settings" memory structure and then re-saved.
Also we make "reverse" setting be saved. We use it for duplex printing for convenience - to
avoid switching to another tab.
--------------------------
@PJL JOB START=x does not work (but END=y works), so we have to generate original .pdf with
only those pages which we want to print. Therefore, "current page" or "range" in print
dialog are useless.
Use p=<range spec as -s option in dvipdfmx> tex ...
